                    BandTogether is a website to help hobbyist musicians meet and network with one another. 
                    It was created as I myself was having a hard time finding band mates to play with during my busy schedule.
                    The philosophy was a good website equals a better experience networking with fellow musicans. 
                    Hopefully you found more joy playing music live as a result of this website!
