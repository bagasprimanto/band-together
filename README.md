# Development Project

## Name
BandTogether website

## Description
This dissertation outlines the creation of a musician networking website for hobbyists, called “BandTogether”. Though the website is not meant to be publicly launched, the website enables users to connect with local musicians, discover collaboration opportunities, and arrange live performances through key features like profile creation, advertisement posting, an open mic finder, and messaging. To determine which functionalities to include, an analysis of existing musician networking websites and mobile apps was conducted. Once analysis was complete, a set of functional and non-functional requirements were generated and documented with the use of user stories and were prioritized using the MoSCoW prioritization framework.

Subsequently, the BandTogether website was then developed following the Agile software development approach for 12 weeks long, with each sprint lasting 1 week. Once developed, the website was subjected to various types of testing to verify that the website meets the functional and non-functional requirements previously set. Overall, the website exhibited satisfactory functional correctness, compatibility, and usability based on test results.

The developed website is deployed on a cloud service and is available to access through this link https://band-together.onrender.com and a video demonstration of the website available on https://youtu.be/6gaKMLYvG5I.

I would like to thank Dr. Mary Ellen Foster for her patience and guidance all throughout the process of writing this dissertation and developing the BandTogether website. I would also like to thank my family, my girlfriend, and my closest friends for taking the time to help in usability testing and for their endless support throughout the progression of my postgraduate taught degree.

## Project status
All “must have” and “should have” user stories are completed which means that all core features of the BandTogether website have been implemented. This achievement resulted on the website having essential features such as profile creation, advertisement creation, inbox messaging, and a simple open mic finder, a unique feature compared to competing websites surveyed. Additionally, 1 out of 6 “could have” user stories and 2 out of 7 “would have” user stories were implemented.

Furthermore, the BandTogether website received positive feedback from the usability tests. Every task in the usability testing achieved a 100% completion rate, demonstrating the website's effectiveness. Additionally, the site showed high levels of user satisfaction and efficiency, supported by strong average SEQ scores and NPS. With successful manual and environment tests, along with solid code coverage from unit tests, the BandTogether website has successfully delivered a well-functioning MVP website for musician networking.
